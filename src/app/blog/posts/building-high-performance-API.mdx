## The Challenge

Healthcare systems generate enormous amounts of data daily. When building Casemix Pintar, we needed to process thousands of claims, handle large file uploads (200MB+), and maintain real-time responsiveness. Traditional REST APIs often struggle with these requirements.

## Why Go and Fiber?

Go's concurrency model and Fiber's performance make them perfect for healthcare applications:

- **Goroutines**: Handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Excellent garbage collection for long-running processes
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking prevents runtime issues
- **Fiber Performance**: Up to 40x faster than Express.js

## Key Implementation Strategies

### Database Optimization
```go
// Implemented table partitioning for better query performance
func (c *ClaimData) GetPartitionName() string {
    if c.KodeRS == "" {
        return "claim_data_default"
    }
    sanitized := strings.ReplaceAll(c.KodeRS, "-", "_")
    return fmt.Sprintf("claim_data_%s", sanitized)
}
```

### Batch Processing
```go
// Process large datasets in batches to prevent memory overflow
batchSize := 1000
for start := 0; start < len(claims); start += batchSize {
    end := start + batchSize
    if end > len(claims) {
        end = len(claims)
    }
    chunk := claims[start:end]
    // Process chunk...
}
```

## Results

- **99.9% Uptime**: Zero downtime during peak processing hours
- **Sub-second Response**: Average API response time under 200ms
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ concurrent users without performance degradation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always implement proper indexing** - Database performance is crucial
2. **Use connection pooling** - Prevents database connection exhaustion
3. **Implement circuit breakers** - Graceful degradation during high load
4. **Monitor everything** - Comprehensive logging and metrics are essential
